# Exploring-ML
This repository contains all the programs that I created while learning about machine learning and neural networks except from the snake reinforcement learning program.
It includes digit recognition using a neural network, a program that fits a linear regression to some randomly generated data and a program that guesses the users scalar input by applying the scalar to some data and then using gradient descent and tweaking a weight parameter.
