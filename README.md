# Exploring-ML
This repository contains all the programs that I created while learning about machine learning and neural networks except from the snake reinforcement learning program.

It includes: 
* two digit recognition programs using a neural network(one using a ML library and the other one using no ML libraries)
* a program that fits a linear regression to some randomly generated data (uses ML library)
* a program that guesses the users scalar input by applying the scalar to some data and then using gradient descent and tweaking a weight parameter (no ML library used).
